Our pixel art app is the perfect tool for creating pixel art, whether you're a beginner or a professional. We use nine-slice images to make it easy and fun to create stunning artwork. With over 50 free assets included, you can let your imagination run wild and create something truly unique.

Our app is currently being developed with a focus on user-friendliness, so anyone can use it regardless of skill level. We are committed to updating the app regularly, so you can expect new features and assets to be added frequently. 

*TESTERS NEEDED*  wanna try the app early  so why not give our app a try by emailing me @  goldenstudent4321@gmail.com  to unleash see what wonders you will be able to create when the app is complete!

*Collaborators Needed* there aren't many sprites in the app for users to make their sprites , please comment anywhere if you want to contribute sprites and proper attribution will be given on itch and the about or info page on the app if attribution requested



The plugin loader currently only works if the app is named correctly, do not rename anything and if you copy the file, make sure it is in the different folder as the original and rename it the original app name

*please send this app to your friends and family and anyone interested*

sharing is caring ;)

thank you for your time!

also if you want to save your work the app doesn't support saving files to a custom directory so u may have to dig into the files for that :)



Known Errors: 

on macOS if your device is on light mode the app will look weird,  icons won't show properly etc. but I am working on a fix, its super  easy just a bit tedious.

if you reaplly nineslice with new changes and the image is too small the app quits

transform box shows even after you delete an object

trying to copy a shape-itm or an item created from a shape tool quits the app wompwomp ;(

as of now tinting and recoloring of sprites is not supported so find the output image and recolor it in any pixel art software if you wish

to save you use cmd/ctrl + shft+ b

if you are on mac the save files are shown in "Contents/Macos/Output"

if you are on windows the file saves in the /Output folder
