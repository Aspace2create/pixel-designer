# How To Contribute
here is a short breif page for people who want to know how they can contribute!!!

## Images
if you want to submit images to avoid copyright issues provide image or video proof of you creating the images or just make sure it is unique in a way that google lens wont pull up like 5 places where that exact image is used, and under a different name.

im not gonna stress too much on that but to avoid legal trouble dont submit someone elses art in this. i am working on a digital baby contract that you will fill out pre-submission

** there are 3 types of image files ninepak(nineslice), bunchpak(multiple pngs stored in 1 file) pak(essentially a png compressed into a zip format) and png(you know what that is)

also there are icons that can be incorporated but im gonna add more information on that at a latter time

## CodePlugins
as for code plugins, there are 3 types of plugins there are 3rd party recommended plugins (these are plugins that go hand in hand with other plugins and are but a feauture the user can add if they want) there are annexed plugins (these are plugins fully adopted into the app and will usually be voted upon) and there are also lastly override plugins (these are plugins that override built in plugins/tools)
